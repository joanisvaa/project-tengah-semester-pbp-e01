## Backstory of The Application
Modern economy is one of the most complex structure in human civilization, that have been formed from the early days of the humans until the era of digital technology. It puts everybody, you and me included, in it's structure of supply and demand. And because of this, the will of people to "bond" with it, by investing for instance, have been higher than ever. That's why we need a system that can provide reliable and accurate information about trading and investment. our target is that trading and investment can be accessed by everyone, from corporates to even a person that has never heard about it.
